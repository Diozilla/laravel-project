 packages used : https://github.com/jeremykenedy/laravel-roles => for roles and permissions// laravel breeze for auth / 




account must be admin to access the dashboard / 





CATEGORIES AND PRODUCTS WHEN U ADD ANY MAKE SURE U DONT CHECK STATUS CUZ   STATUS IS FOR THE SITE ADMINS TO ADD PRODUCTS OR 
CATEGORIES BUT WONT APPEAR FOR THE END USER ITS LIKE PREPARING THE DATABASE FOR THE CAT OR THE PRODUCT THAT WILL BE AVIALABLE 
IN THE FUTURE


dashboard style is from material dashboard from creative tim site 




i guess:
The reason behind the problem of u not finding the category or products is becuase i was working on another database i copied 
the tables so there is a link between both databses the solution is just add a category and a product and it will be working
just fine i suppose this is it 


used bootsrab and tailwind(breeze built in tailwind) .
